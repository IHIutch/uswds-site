        ends_when: The proposal has been open a minimum of 45 days and the core team is ready to evaluate.
      - name: Proposal evaluation
        description: |
          The core team is evaluating the proposal for inclusion in the design system.
          After evaluation, the proposal will either be approved, returned for revision, or marked as “will not pursue.”
      - name: Approved
        description: |
          The core team has determined that the proposed component is a good fit for the design system.
          Components in this phase are ready to be developed.
        contribution_method: |
          Reach out if you want to build this component.
        ends_when: The component is assigned and scheduled for development.
      - name: Will not pursue
        class: rejected
        description: |
          The core team has determined that the proposed component is not a good fit for the design system.
          These components will not be developed.
  - name: Development
    description: Design, develop, test, and document new components
    subphases:
      - name: Assigned
        description: |
         A team has committed to building this component.
        ends_when: The component starts to be developed.
      - name: In development
        description: |
         Design, develop, test, document, and release the proposed concept
        ends_when: The component is ready for release.
  - name: Released
    description: Release components to the public
    subphases:
      - name: Experimental
        class: experimental
        description: |
          Provide early access to the component prior to stable release.
          These components have core functionality and production-quality code but might need additional testing, documentation, or features.
      - name: Stable
        description: |
          Release components to the general public.
          These components must meet all standards, have full functionality, and have complete documentation.
          These components will regularly be audited for accessibility and usability.
        ends_when: A component moves to "use with caution" or "deprecation".
      - name: Use with caution
        class: caution
        description: |
          The component does not currently meet standards and is in need of significant rework.
          The component will still receive maintenance and updates,
          but we recommend ...
        ends_when: A component is either returned to stable status or moved to deprecation.
  - name: Deprecated
    description: Phase out components that do not meet standards or are no longer needed
    subphases:
      - name: Deprecated
        description: |
          The core team removes components from active support.
          This means that the component is still available in the code base but will not receive any updates
          and we cannot assure that it meets standards.
          Deprecation can happen for a number of reasons including security risks, failure to meet standards, or replacement by a new feature.
      - name: Retired
        description: |
          The core team removes components from the code base. This is the end of the component lifecycle.
