      - name: Conditionally approved
        description: |
          The USWDS core team determined that the component could be a good fit for the design system, but other work must be completed before development can be scheduled.
          Development for these components will be put on hold until the related work is finished.
          Once the related work is complete, the component will move to the “approved” state.
        starts_when: The USWDS core team approves the component proposal.

          The USWDS core team returns a proposal for revision.
        ends_when: |
          Contributors to the component discussion address the gaps in the proposal, and the USWDS core team updates the proposal for re-evaluation.

          You'll need to build any experimental component from an approved component proposal.
          If another team already has the assignment for an approved proposal, that team's work takes priority.
      - name: Stable
        description: |
          The component has an established history in production.
          These components must meet all USWDS requirements, have full functionality, and have complete documentation.
