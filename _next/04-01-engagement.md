USWDS is a product with significant customer service and community aspects. To meet agency teams where they are, the design system needs to be easily understood by a variety of audiences. There are opportunities to develop outreach initiatives and website content that more effectively communicate the value of the design system, while continuing to invest in the community that’s essential for the design system’s growth as a good-for- government resource.

### Reach new customers and leadership

To accomplish this, we recommend increasing outreach and targeted communications to new customers and agency leadership with these opportunities.

### Building momentum
In November 2020, the USWDS team presented a webinar hosted by the [CIO Council](https://www.cio.gov/)’s 508 subcommittee to share the purpose, value, and how-to’s of the design system. After the webinar, the 326 attendees (from both in and outside of the federal government) were asked if they would seek additional information about the design system after having attended the event — 69 percent of them reported they strongly agreed or agreed. Hosting more webinars or events in connection with others working in digital fields across government will help to bolster engagement around the design system.
