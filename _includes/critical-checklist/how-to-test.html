### How you should test
Use the checklist below to perform your own accessibility testing on the components in your project.
You do not need to be an accessibility expert to perform these tests.

The checklist will walk you through each test using three types of assistive technology:
[zoom magnification](#zoom-magnification-tests), [keyboard control](#keyboard-control-tests), and [screen readers](#screen-reader-tests).
<!-- Each test is written with instructions specific to the accordion component. -->
You can find instructions for using each type of assistive technology in the "how to test" accordions found in each section.
