### How we test
Our accessibility team regularly completes the tests in this checklist
to confirm that our components conform to WCAG 2.1 AA standards at a system level.
However, there are some tests that can only be performed in the context of a project.

### How you should test
To consider a component accessible, you need to test your implementation.
Perform your own accessibility testing in your project by completing the tests in the checklists on this page.
