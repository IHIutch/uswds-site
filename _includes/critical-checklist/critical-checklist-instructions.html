    You don't need to be an accessibility expert to test USWDS components. The checklists below will walk you through
    how to test items that are critical for component accessibility.

    The checklists will reflect the current test results for the component with either a green checkmark to indicate a
    passing score, a red x to indicate a failing score, and a blue question mark to indicate that it is something that
    can only be tested on implementation.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Manually test your own implementation of the accordion component.</b> USWDS intends to provide components
        that are accessible; however, accessibility ultimately depends on how you implement them in your context. Use
        the checklists below as your guide to test the component in your project.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Build accessibility into your team'â€™'s workflow.</b> Consider a component done or ready for implementation
        only after it has passed the manual testing checklists provided in the section below.
