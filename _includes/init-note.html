<p class="site-note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> We recommend loading <code>uswds-init.js</code> when using banner, header, or modal components to assist in preventing flashes of unstyled content (FOUC) as well as cumulative layout shift (CLS). This small JavaScript file (less than 1 KB minified) helps the browser know if the USWDS JavaScript library is loading properly.

  <br>
  To add <code>uswds-init</code>code> to your site, simply copy <code>uswds-init.min.js</code> from <code>dist/js</code> into your site assets and reference the file in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of your HTML files. Alternatively, you can inline its contents directly into a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag in your HTML files.
