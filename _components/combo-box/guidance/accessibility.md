- **Known assistive technology issues.** Testing with people using assistive technology revealed [usability concerns](https://github.com/uswds/uswds-site/issues/1898) that require additional investigation. At this time, consider using a [Select component]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/select) instead of a Combo box for better screen reader and keyboard navigation support. More research and testing is planned to better understand and address these accessibility issues. If you would like to contribute to improving this component, please [join our community]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/community/) and share your feedback.
- **Customize form controls accessibly.** If you customize this component, ensure that it continues to meet the [accessibility requirements that apply to all form controls]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/form).
- **Always use a label.**  Make sure your select element has a label. Don’t replace it with the default menu option (for example, removing the “State” label and just having the menu read “Select a state” by default).
- **Avoid auto-submission.** Don’t use JavaScript to automatically submit the form (or do anything else) when an option is selected. Auto-submission disrupts screen readers because they select each option as they read them.
