- **Fewer than seven options.** Use radio buttons instead.
- **More than 15 options.** If the list of options is very long, consider using a [combo box]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/combo-box).
- **Multi-select.** If you need to allow users to choose more than one option at once. Users often donâ€™t understand how to choose multiple items from select elements. Use checkboxes instead.
- **Site navigation.** Use the navigation components instead.
