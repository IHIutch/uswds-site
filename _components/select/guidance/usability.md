- **Make sure to test.** Test select menus thoroughly with members of your target audience. Several usability experts suggest they should be the “UI of last resort.” Many users find them confusing and difficult to use.
- **Avoid dependent options.** Avoid making options in one select menu change based on the input to another. Users often don’t understand how choosing an item in one impacts another.
- **Use a good default.** When most users will (or should) pick a particular option, make it the default: `<option selected="selected">Default</option>`
- **Avoid auto-submission.** Don’t use JavaScript to automatically submit the form (or do anything else) when an option is chosen. Offer a “submit” button at the end of the form instead. Users often change their choices multiple times. Auto-submission is also less accessible.
