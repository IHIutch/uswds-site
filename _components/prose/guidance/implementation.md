- `usa-prose` is meant for blocks of text where itâ€™s more difficult to add custom classes to individual elements, like a blog post where the content is coming out of markdown or a CMS.
- Adding `usa-prose` to any container adds USWDS default heading and body text styling to the following **direct-child elements**:
  - `h1`-`h6`
  - `p`
  - `ul` and `ol`, _plus_ child `li`
  - `table`, _plus_ child `thead`, `th`, `td`, and `caption`
- You can change the measure of elements styled with `usa-prose` in `_uswds-theme-typography.scss` with the following variables. Each accepts a measure token:
  - `$theme-text-measure`
  - `$theme-lead-measure`
