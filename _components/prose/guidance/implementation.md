- `usa-prose` is meant for blocks of text where itâ€™s more difficult to add custom classes to individual elements, like a blog post where the content is coming out of markdown or a CMS.
- Adding `usa-prose` to any container adds USWDS default heading and body text styling to the following **direct-child elements**:
  - `h1`-`h6`
  - `p`
  - `ul` and `ol`, _plus_ child `li`
  - `table`, _plus_ child `thead`, `th`, `td`, and `caption`
- Customize line-length by changing the value of `$theme-text-measure` and `$theme-lead-measure` in your [USWDS settings configuration]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/settings). Each setting accepts a [measure token]({{ site.baseurl }}/design-tokens/typesetting/measure/). 
  - `$theme-text-measure`
  - `$theme-lead-measure`
