- **Be thoughtful about the number of steps.** A process list should include between three and ten steps to prevent it from getting too unwieldy or confusing.
- **Use consistent headings.** Headings should be written with a parallel structure (e.g., all start with an action verb, etc.), including consistent end punctuation, and should be short enough to fit on one line, if possible.
- **Add other types of content as needed.** The body of each list item can be used to display additional rich text content including HTML, images, and other components like buttons, images, simple lists, links, and tables.
