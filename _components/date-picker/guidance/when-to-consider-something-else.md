- **Familiar dates.** When asking users for a date they know well, or can look up without using a calendar (like a birthday), use [memorable date]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/memorable-date) fields.
- **When the day of the week is irrelevant.** If there's no benefit to knowing the day of the week for a particular date, consider [memorable date]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/memorable-date) fields.
