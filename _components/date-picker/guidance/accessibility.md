- **Customize form controls accessibly.** If you customize this component, ensure that it continues to meet the [accessibility requirements that apply to all form controls]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/form).
- **Avoid auto-submission.** Donâ€™t use JavaScript to automatically submit the form (or do anything else) when an option is selected. Auto-submission disrupts screen readers because they select each option as they read them.
