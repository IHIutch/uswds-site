- **Use fields appropriate to the length of the input.** The length of the text input provides a hint to users as to how much text to write. Do not require users to write paragraphs of text into a single-line input box; use a text area instead.
- **Wait to validate.** Only show error validation messages or stylings after a user has interacted with a particular field.
