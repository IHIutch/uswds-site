The following examples are common input masks, however you can alter the code to meet the needs of your project. In order to extend the functionality of the input mask, you can include a new regular expression (regex) pattern as the pattern attribute of the `<input>` tag. You must also include`id` and `placeholder` attributes in order for the script to execute correctly. Additionally, make sure you add a descriptive title to the `<input>` as well, as it will be read by a screen reader and assist with accessibility.
