The examples are common input masks, however you can alter the code to meet the needs of your project. In order to extend the functionality of the input mask, you must include the `data-placeholder` attribute as the visible input mask, using the underscore `_` to function as expected characters. You may also use dashes `-` and the forward slash `/` to help build a viable mask, but these will not count as the intended characters for the value. This placeholder must relate directly to the regular expression (regex) pattern as the `pattern` attribute of the `<input>` tag. Additionally, make sure to add a descriptive `title` to the `<input>`, as it will be read by a screen reader and help describe the desired input.
