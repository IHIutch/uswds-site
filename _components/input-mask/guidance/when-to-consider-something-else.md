- **The input is a free-form field.** Input masking is not appropriate when the expected value can take many formats.
- **The input pattern is too complicated to allow for a valid input mask.** A pattern like email, with many possible scenarios for input, is not a good candidate for masking. Allow the user to enter their email address (or other complicated data) without a mask and instead have your validation library confirm before form submission.
