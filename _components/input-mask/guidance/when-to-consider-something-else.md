- **When the input requires a free-form field.** When there isn't a common input pattern to use
- **When the pattern is too complicated to allow for a valid input mask.** A pattern like email, with many possible scenarios for input, is not a good candidate for masking. Allow the user to enter their email address (or other complicated data) and have your validation library confirm it's valid data before form submission.
