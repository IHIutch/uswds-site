- **Short pages.** For pages that require little or no scrolling, in-page navigation is not necessary.
- **Mobile.** For smaller screens, in-page navigation should be hidden.
- **Infinite scrolling.** For pages that feature infinite scrolling, in-page navigation is not a practical nor a feasible feature, so it is not recommended.
