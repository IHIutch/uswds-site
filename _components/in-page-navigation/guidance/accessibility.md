- **Allow keyboard navigation.** Users should be able to navigate between items by using the `Tab` key. They should also be able to activate a link when pressing `Enter` on their keyboard. Users should be able to activate hover and focus states with both a mouse and a keyboard.

- **Keyboard users should access the in-page navigation before the main content.** When a user tabs through a page that contains the in-page navigation component, they should find the in-page navigation _before_ the `main` content. Since the in-page navigation appears after the main content in the reading order, this may seem like a tab-order error. However, tabbing through the entire page before getting to in-page navigation links is not logical, creates confusion, and diminishes the user experience.

- **Set focus state on section target for keyboard users.** When keyboard users follow an in-page anchor link set the focus state to the link target when the user presses the `Enter` key. When mouse users follow an in-page anchor link the focus should remain on the selected link.
