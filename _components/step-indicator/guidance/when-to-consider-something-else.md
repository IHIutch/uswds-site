- **Long forms with conditional logic.** Consider another approach if the number of steps might change due to user input.
- **Nonlinear progression.** The step indicator isn't appropriate for nonlinear forms or interactions that might be completed in any order.
- **Very short forms.** Donâ€™t use a step indicator for short forms without chapters or sections. If a form or process has fewer than three sections, don't use a step indicator.
