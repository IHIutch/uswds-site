- **There should be enough color contrast between the button, the text inside the button, and the background to ensure readability.**
- **Provide a visual element that shows when the text is a link.** For example, permanently underline text or when hovering.
- **If the text will be visually presented as a button but coded as a link**, it is recommended to add ARIA `role="button"` so that screen readers announce it as a button. Additionally, JavaScript will also need to be added so that keyboard users can activate the button using both the Enter and Spacebar keys. See for reference: [Understanding Success Criterion 4.1.2 Understanding WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/ensure-compat-rsv.html).
- **The language of the page should be identified using the HTML lang attribute** (`<html lang="en">`, for example). Please see the link for reference [H57: Using the language attribute on the HTML element](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H57).
- **If the page is in English but some content/words are in different languages**, then the second language should be defined using the lang attribute on a `<span>` tag wrapping the relevant text (e.g., "`<span lang="es">Hola</span>` means Hello‚Äù). Please see the link for reference [H58: Using language attributes to identify changes in the human language](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H58).
