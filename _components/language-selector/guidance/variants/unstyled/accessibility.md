- **There should be enough color contrast between the text of the link and the background to ensure readability.**
- **Provide a visual element that shows when the text is a link.** For example, permanently underline text or when hovering.
- **All logically related items/links must be presented as an HTML unordered list.** See link for references [H48: Using ol, ul and dl for lists or groups of links](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H48).
- **The language of the page should be identified using the HTML lang attribute (`<html lang="en">`, for example).** Please see the link for reference [H57: Using the language attribute on the HTML element](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H57).
- **If the page is in English but some content/words are in different languages**, then the second language should be defined using the lang attribute on a `<span>` tag wrapping the relevant text (e.g., “`<span lang="es">Hola</span>` means Hello”). Please see the link for reference [H58: Using language attributes to identify changes in the human language](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H58).
