- **Use unordered lists and list items.** Use a `ul` for a collection and an `li` for each item. This allows screen readers to enumerate the items in the collection and allows shortcuts between list items.
- **Use the appropriate heading level for your page.** Update heading levels based on the content of your page to make sure collection headings are in the correct logical outline order..
- **Each link should have a unique name.** Those using assistive technology may collect all page links together. Unique names not only help these users distinguish between links, but help all users scan the page. Favor using link text itself to provide a unique name. Using a `title` attribute or `aria-label` to provide a unique name helps users of assistive technology, but doesn't promote scannability in standard browsers.
