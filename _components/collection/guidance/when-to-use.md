- **To feature content with its metadata.** The collection component is a good option when displaying content that should be accompanied by limited metadata like tags, date/time, or source and attribution.
- **To group related content together.** The collection component can provide links to articles from a trusted source, popular guides and resources, or a collection of pages that cover different aspects of a single topic.
- **To collect items from multiple sources.** Use collections when you want to guide users to additional resources available elsewhere. Collections introduce themes that help users find what theyâ€™re looking for, including when it's not on your site.
