- **Validate on the server side as well.** The validation component is intended primarily for usability, not as a robust security solution, since all the validation logic occurs on the client side. The validation should be "mirrored" on the server-side for security purposes.
- **Connect the input element to your validation checklist.** Set the value of your input's `data-validation-element` to the `id` of its related `.usa-checklist`. For example, if the `.usa-checklist` element has an `id` of `validate-code`, use `data-validation-element="validate-code"`.
- **Customize the validation attributes.** For each type of validation you'd like to provide feedback on:
  1. Come up with a custom name for your validator, e.g. `uppercase`. This name shouldn't have any spaces in it.
  2. On the appropriate list item in `.usa-checklist`, set the `data-validator` attribute to the name of your custom validator, e.g. `data-validator="uppercase"`. This is the list item that will appear "checked" when the validator's condition is met.
  3. On the input element, add an attribute called `data-validate-[validator name]`, where `[validator name]` is the custom name you created in step 1. Define this attribute with a [regular expression](https://regexone.com/) (described on RegexOne) that represents whether the validator's condition is met. For example, if your custom validator is called `uppercase`, use `data-validate-uppercase="[A-Z]"`.

    For reference, you can find the complete implementation of this configuration in the “Component code” accordion panel at the top of this page.
