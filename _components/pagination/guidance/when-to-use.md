- **Search results.** Pagination is most commonly used with paginated search results. Our Pagination component is designed to work both with results that have a discrete number of results pages (bounded) and those with an uncalculated number of results pages (unbounded). See [Using the Pagination component](#using-the-pagination-component), below, for more on bounded and unbounded sets.

- **Multi-page collections of related items.** Splitting a large collection of related items into individual pages can improve browsability and scannability. Common examples of multi-page collections include articles related to a category or tag, content archives, and history or activity.
