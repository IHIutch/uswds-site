- **Meaningful page groupings.** If you have long content split meaningfully, or grouped by subject or theme, use conventional navigation like [Side navigation]({% link _components/sidenav/sidenav.md %}).

- **Steps in a sequence.** If you need to indicate progress in a series of steps that must be completed in succession, like an onboarding flow, consider using the [step indicator component]({% link _components/step-indicator/step-indicator.md %}).

- **Short collections.** If the length of the entire collection is less than 3-4 screen lengths long, consider showing all the items at once instead of paginating.
