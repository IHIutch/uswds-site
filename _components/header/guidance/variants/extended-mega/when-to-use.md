- **Lots of sections.** Use an extended header with a mega menu if you have too many sections in your horizontal navigation to fit comfortably in the basic header format.
- **Secondary links or specific calls to action.** This type of header is also useful if you’d like to include secondary links or specific calls to action in addition to the main content navigation — for example `Log in` and `Sign up` links.
- **Deep hierarchy.** Use this type of header if you’d like to include more than six links in any of your dropdowns.
