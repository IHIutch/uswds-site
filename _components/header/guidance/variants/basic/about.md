- Use the basic header if you have few enough sections in your main navigation to fit comfortably next to your logo; this decision will depend on the length of your text and whether you include a search bar. You can customize the header (depending on your site structure) and use it with:
  - A text or image logo
  - With or without dropdown menus
  - With or without a search bar
  - With or without call-to-action buttons in place of the search bar
