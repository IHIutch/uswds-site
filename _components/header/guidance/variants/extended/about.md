An extended header allows for the inclusion of more sections in a horizontal navigation. You can customize the header (depending on your site structure) and use it:
- With a text or image logo
- With or without dropdown menus
- With or without the expandable search bar
- With or without call-to-action buttons in place of the secondary links featured in your horizontal navigation
