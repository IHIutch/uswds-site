The basic header with a megamenu is similar in design to the basic header component. The megamenu allows for the inclusion of more links in dropdown menus. You can customize this header (depending on your site structure) and use it with:
- A text or image logo
- With or without a search bar
- With or without call-to-action buttons in place of the search bar
