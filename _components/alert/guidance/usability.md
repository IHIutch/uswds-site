- **Consider next steps.** When the user is required to do something in response to an alert, let them know what they need to do, and make that task as easy as possible. Think about how much context to provide with your message. For example, a notification of a system change may require more contextual information than a validation message. Write the message in concise, human-readable language; avoid jargon and computer code.
- **Be polite.** Be polite in error messages — don’t blame the user.
- **Alerts are an opportunity.** Users will read a message that helps them resolve an error even if they generally won’t read documentation; include some educational material in your error message.
- **Don’t overdo it.** Too many notifications will either overwhelm or annoy the user and are likely to be ignored.
- **Allow a user to dismiss a notification wherever appropriate.**
- **Understand the user’s context.** Don’t include notifications that aren’t related to the user’s current goal.
