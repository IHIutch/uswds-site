- **Long forms.** On long forms, always include in-line validation in addition to any error messages that appear at the top of the form.
- **Destructive actions.** If an action will result in destroying a userâ€™s work (for example, deleting an application) use a more intrusive pattern, such as a confirmation modal dialogue, to allow the user to confirm that this action is what they want.
