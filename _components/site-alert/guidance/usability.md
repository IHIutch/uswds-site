- **Place prominently.** Use a full-width site alert positioned near the top of the page so it's one of the first things users see.
- **Avoid stacking multiple site alerts.** If you need to convey more than one message, provide a list of links within a single site alert instead of multiple, stacked alerts.
- **Avoid overwhelming use of color.** It may be tempting to make heavy use of bright red or orange to draw attention to an emergency-related site alert. However, these colors can produce strong negative emotional reactions such as fear or panic. Positioning the banner at the top of the screen provides enough weight that such strong colors may not be necessary.
