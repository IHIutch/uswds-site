- **Unpredictable or freeform responses.** If you can’t reasonably predict a user’s answer to a prompt and there might be wide variability in users’ answers.
- **Input simplicity.** When using another type of input will make answering more difficult. For example, birthdays and other known dates are easier to type in than they are to select from a <a href="https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/date-picker/">date picker</a>.
- **Pasted content.** When users want to be able to paste in a response.
