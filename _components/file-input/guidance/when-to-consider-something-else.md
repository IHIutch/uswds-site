- **Documents are optional.** Avoid asking users to provide documents if you don't require them.
- **Asynchronous upload.** The file input component doesn't support asynchronous uploading. Files are POSTed only on form submission.
- **Asking for large files.** Be mindful that some users might have limited connectivity or data plans.
