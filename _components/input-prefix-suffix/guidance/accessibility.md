- **Hide from screen readers.** Prefixes and suffixes are hidden from screen readers using `aria-hidden`.

- **Use descriptive labels.** Labels should clearly indicate what type of data to enter since prefixes and suffixes are hidden from screen readers. For example, if you’re requesting someone’s height in inches, you have “in.” appear in a suffix, but your form label should say “Height, in inches.”
