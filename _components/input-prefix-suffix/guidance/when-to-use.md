- **Highlight the type of information.** Prefixes and suffixes are useful when thereâ€™s a commonly understood symbol or abbreviation for the type of information the user needs to enter. Some common examples include units of measurement (like lbs or ft), symbols (like $ or %), or even icons (like showing an eye for password visibility).

- **Input cannot include units.** Use prefixes and suffixes if the input refers to a unit or currency amount (like a length or dollar amount), but the user's input must include digits only, not units or a currency symbol.

- **Reduce mental load.** Adding a prefix or suffix can help the user more quickly understand what kind of information is requested.
