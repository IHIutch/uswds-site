- **Confirmation.** Use modals to force the user to complete a task or make a decision that requires their full attention outside of the main workflow. These modals are usually triggered by a user action on the page and offer more than one option to proceed — such as a “yes” and “no” button. They are commonly used to confirm user actions or tasks that can’t be undone.

  Examples:
  - “Your work isn’t saved. Do you want to proceed?”
  - “Are you sure you want to cancel?”

- **Acknowledgement before continuing.** These modals are used as a “gate” to prevent users from moving forward without acknowledging or answering specific information in the modal. A key differentiator of these modals is that a user should not be able to close the modal or escape without making a selection — this means the “close” button should be disabled on these modals. It also means there needs to be a clear way to accept or reject the content in the modal.

  Examples:
  - “By using this website, you are agreeing to our privacy policy.”
  - “Your session is about to timeout. Do you need more time?”
  - “Are you 65 or older?”

- **Explanatory content without disrupting a process.** A modal can be used to display information without taking users away from a process or task. These modals usually show optional information to help a user gain further understanding about what they’re doing — for instance, displaying a privacy policy while creating an account or viewing an in-depth definition or explanation while filling out a form. Typically these modals don’t require a user to take action other than closing it.
