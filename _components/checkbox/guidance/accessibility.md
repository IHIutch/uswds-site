- **Customize form controls accessibly.** If you customize this component, ensure that it continues to meet the [accessibility requirements that apply to all form controls]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/form).
- **Use a fieldset and legend for a checkbox group.** Surround a related set of checkboxes with a `<fieldset>`. The `<legend>` provides context for the grouping. Donâ€™t use fieldset and legend for a single check.
- **These custom checkboxes are accessible.** The custom checkboxes here are accessible to screen readers because the default checkboxes are moved off-screen with `position: absolute; left: -999em`.
- **Use semantic tags.** Each input should have a semantic tag for the `id` attribute, and its corresponding label should have the same value in its `for` attribute.
