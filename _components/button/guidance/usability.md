- **Use standard buttons for actions that go a next step.**
- **Use outline buttons for actions that happen on the current page.**
- **Give an important action a distinctive style.** Style the button most users should select in a way that distinguishes it from other buttons on the page. Try using the `usa-button--big` variant or the most visually distinct color variant.
- **Make sure buttons look selectable.** Use color variations to distinguish static, hover, and active states.
- **Avoid using too many buttons on a page.**
- **Use sentence-case capitalization for button labels.**
- **Keep button text short.** Button text should be as short as possible with action words that clearly explain what will happen when the button is selected (for example, `Download`, `View`, or `Sign up`).
- **Lead with a verb.** Make the first word of the buttonâ€™s text a verb. For example, instead of `Complaint filing`, label the button `File a complaint`.
- **Icons can be helpful.** Consider adding an icon to signal specific actions (`Download`, `Open in a new window`, etc).
