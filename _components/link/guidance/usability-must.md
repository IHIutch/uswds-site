- **Clearly identify external links.** [OMB’s Policies for Federal Agency Public Websites and Digital Services [PDF, 1.2 MB]](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/legacy_drupal_files/omb/memoranda/2017/m-17-06.pdf) states that agencies “must clearly identify external links from their websites" and that they "should choose the best approach to identify external links to users in a way that minimizes the impact on the usability of their websites and digital services.”
- **Provide required notification for non-federal external links.** [OMB’s Policies for Federal Agency Public Websites and Digital Services [PDF, 1.2 MB]](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/legacy_drupal_files/omb/memoranda/2017/m-17-06.pdf) states that you “must clearly state that the content of external links to non-federal agency websites is not endorsed by the federal government.”

    This requirement has two aspects:

    - **Notification:** We recommend employing a clear, consistent, user-friendly approach for _all_ external links whether government or non-government links (see [What you should do](#what-you-should-do), below).
    - **Non-endorsement:** We recommend adding language to a policy and notices page on your site to explain to users that the agency does not endorse the information on any linked non-federal site. See, for example, [USA.gov’s linking policy](https://www.usa.gov/linking-policy).

    Check with your [Federal Web Council representative [digital.gov]](https://digital.gov/resources/federal-web-council/) and General Counsel regarding agency requirements for this endorsement language and notification approach.

        <p><strong>11. Ensure Information Quality and Accuracy</strong></p>
        <p>The Internet enables agencies to communicate information quickly and easily to a wide audience, which, while of great benefit to society, also increases the potential harm that can result from disseminating incorrect information. Taking this into account, information disseminated from Federal Government websites and digital services, or from third-party services on behalf of the Government, is expected to be authoritative and reliable.</p>
        <p>The Information Quality Act applies to all information disseminated from Federal websites, and in certain cases, to information published to third-party sites on behalf of the Government. OMB has published Information Quality Guidelines to help agencies meet this requirement.</p>
