- **Don’t rely on only color to distinguish links.** Site visitors should be able to distinguish text links from surrounding text. In most cases, include an underline or bottom border on text links, in addition to a consistent link color. Text links not distinguished with an underline need a contrast level of at least 3:1 with their surrounding text (the same as AA Large, or a USWDS magic number of `40`) and should show an underline on hover.

- **Don't block external links with disruptive notifications.** Allow users to follow external links without taking a separate action to acknowledge leaving your site. Roadblock notices, such as modals and dialog boxes, result in a poor user experience. Instead, communicate about a link’s destination through [descriptive link text](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/link/#what-you-should-do) and external link indicators. Use your site’s policy and notices page to provide important information about non-government sites without disrupting the user experience. 

- **Don’t use generic link text.** Vague text like “click here” and “read more” is confusing and repetitive, especially to people using screen readers. Link text should describe the destination and explain where users will go if they follow the link.

- **Don’t use the same link text for different URLs on the same page.** Differentiate between links by using unique text for each.
