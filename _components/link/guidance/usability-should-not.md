- **Don’t rely on color alone to distinguish links.** Site visitors should be able to distinguish text links from surrounding text. In most cases, include an underline or bottom border on text links, in addition to a consistent link color. Text links not distinguished with an underline need a contrast level of at least 3:1 with their surrounding text (the same as AA Large, or a USWDS magic number of `40`) and should show an underline on hover.

- **Don't roadblock external links with a modal window or dialog box.** Allow users to follow external links without taking a separate action to acknowledge leaving your site. Roadblock notices result in a poor user experience and are redundant with both the link's destination context (see [Provide plain text context for external links](#what-you-should-do), above) any external link indicator (see [If you use an external link indicator, use it consistently](#what-you-must-do), above), and your site's policy and notices page (see [Provide required notification for non-federal external links](#what-you-must-do), above).

- **Don’t use generic link text.** Vague text like “click here” and “read more” is confusing and repetitive, especially to screen readers. Link text should describe the destination and explain where users will go if they follow the link.

- **Don’t use the same link text for different URLs on the same page.** Differentiate between links by using unique text for each.
