- **Tabular data.** Don't use a card as a substitute for a table row.
- **Simple calls to action.** Use a button instead.
- **Standalone content.** Consider an `aside` or another standalone element.
- **Sequential, continuous text.** Cards should be self-contained and modular. If the reader is meant to read from card to card, consider a list or simple body text and headings.
