- **Use unordered lists and list items.** Use a `ul` for a card group and an `li` for each card. This formatting allows screen readers to enumerate the items in the card group and allows shortcuts between list items.
- **Use the appropriate heading level for your page.** Update heading level based on the content of your page to make sure card headings are in the correct, logical outline order.
- **Use CSS to order the media element.** Logically, the media element should follow the header element. Don't re-organize the markup to reverse their order.
