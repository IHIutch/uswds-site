- **Control card size and layout with grid utilities.** The `usa-card-group` block is functionally a wrap-able `grid-row`, and each individual `usa-card` is a `grid-col`. This circumstance means you can use a grid utility like `tablet:grid-col-4` to set a four-column size on a card at `tablet` width. You can also set custom grid gaps on a `usa-card-group` using `grid-gap` utilities. Since the Design System grid is based on flexbox, you can use flex positioning utilities on the card group. The default alignment is stretch (stretch aligns the top and bottom of each card in a row), but the `flex-align-start` utility can set the alignment to the top of the row.
- **Style cards with utilities.** Style the `usa-card__container` element with utilities to achieve custom effects, such as changing the border or background color or adding a drop shadow.
