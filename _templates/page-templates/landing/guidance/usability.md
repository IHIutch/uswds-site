- **Remember to do your research.** The landing page can be a good model for a homepage. But do some research first. What do you have to say? What do your users need to know? Figure these things out. It’s important to know what you have to say about your organization before you settle on a homepage design.
- **Don’t make it too complicated.** Don’t try to include forms or side navigation. Those components are visually complex, and a landing page works best when content is kept simple.
- **Simple pages may not need a header.** If you are using the landing page to encourage users to follow a primary call to action, consider getting rid of the header. The less there is to distract people from the most important task, the more often they will do it.
- **Remove unnecessary elements.** Do not create extra content just to fill the template. You can remove individual components (such as the media block) or sub-components (such as individual menu items in the header) from the template as you implement it. This template gives you a broad idea of the number of things your landing page could include, but never make a page more complex than you need to. If you’re unsure, interview users to find out what they need to know.
- **See component-specific guidance.** For guidance on specific components, refer to pages on the components of interest.
