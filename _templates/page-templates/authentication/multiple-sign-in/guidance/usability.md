- **Emphasize one method over others.** Indicate a preferred method by giving it more prominence in your design.
- **Focus on the task.** Remove extraneous content to minimize distractions.
- **Use consistent, accurate language.** Use “sign in” if it’s a verb (like link in a call-to-action or button) or “sign-in” if it's a noun or adjective form (like "sign-in page"). Don’t use “login” or “log in.”
- **Explain why and how.** Let users know the value of accessing their account and explain the purpose of any additional sign-in options.
