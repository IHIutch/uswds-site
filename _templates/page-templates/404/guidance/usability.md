- **Use concise, non-technical language.** Don’t make the error code a prominent part of the page or get into too many details about what went wrong. Be concise and don’t add unnecessary content just to fill the space.

- **Avoid funny, cutesy, or whimsical error messages.** Users might not get the joke or appreciate levity when attempting to access critical information or services. Government website content should always be authoritative and trustworthy.

- **Be apologetic.** Show empathy, and don’t blame the user. Use messaging like “We’re sorry, that page can’t be found” instead of “Whoops, you made a mistake.”

- **Let users know what they can do next.** This might be advice such as correcting typos in the URL or reporting a problem if they think they’ve reached the 404 page in error. Also, give them a way out of the “dead end” error page by directing them to the homepage, a contact page, a search page, or a chatbot/live chat.

- **Use a consistent layout.** The error page should look like your website to avoid confusion. Include the main navigation so that users can navigate directly to another part of the site.

- **Don’t include multiple search boxes.** Only include a search option on the error page if there isn’t already a search box in the site’s header or anywhere else on the page.
