- **Nonstandard addresses.** This template covers domestic U.S. addresses, including the U.S. territories and military outposts. If you need to collect addresses that may not fit this format, such as international addresses for citizens living overseas, you will need to use something else.
- **You don’t need separate data elements.** If you don’t need to be able to parse out the individual pieces of an address, consider letting users type the entire address into one large text area.
