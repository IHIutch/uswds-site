- **Make the entire header selectable.** Allow users to click anywhere in the header area to expand or collapse the content; a larger target is easier to manipulate.
- **Give interactive elements enough space.** Make sure interactive elements within the collapsible region are far enough from the headers that users donâ€™t accidentally trigger a collapse. (The exact distance depends on the device.)
