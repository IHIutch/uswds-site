## What are design patterns?
Patterns are best practice design solutions for specific user tasks and interactions. 

Every day we ask users to engage with our digital products and services. Whether completing a form, creating an account, scheduling an appointment — or even something as simple as drilling down into complex content — we ask them to _interact_ with the products we're building to fulfill a need. 

While most design patterns contain one or more components, patterns go beyond the HTML and CSS that underpin digital interactions. Design patterns provide suggested layouts, key considerations, and research-informed recommendations on how to create successful experiences.

USWDS design patterns are designed to be reusable by developers — and usable by the public. They are also designed to be respectful of the public and the variety of personal and life experiences they bring. This is an evolving space, and norms and language are changing all the time. We expect the patterns to evolve as this space does.
