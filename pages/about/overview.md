## Our history
USWDS was created by a collaborative team at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) and the [U.S. Digital Service](https://www.usds.gov/) in 2015, under the guidance of an advisory board of talented, experienced government staff in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Food and Drug Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, Social Security Administration, Department of Education, Internal Revenue Service, and GSA.

USWDS is a product of GSA’s [Technology Transformation Services](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services), maintained by the Office of Solutions.
