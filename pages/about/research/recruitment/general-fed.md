How the federal USWDS community can participate in our research
Getting feedback from designers, developers, UX practitioners, content strategists, and others in the USWDS community is critical for us to deliver a design system that works for you.

We regularly carry out research to better understand what you need from the design system and to get early feedback on ideas we have.

## Sign up to be added to our list of participants

We’re looking for federal government employees who either currently use USWDS or who are curious about USWDS. We unfortunately can’t include contractors as part of this research effort.

**To sign up:**  Fill out a brief research signup form or email us at <{{ site.uswds_email }}> to tell us you’re interested. We’ll reach out when we have a research opportunity for you.

Your participation is completely voluntary and you can opt out at any time by emailing us at <{{ site.uswds_email }}>.

## What to expect if we invite you to participate

We’ll share the research purpose and details with you when we reach out to see if you’re interested in participating. Typically, participating could mean:

- Offering asynchronous feedback on a concept
- Having a 30-60 minute conversation with us
- Testing a prototype and thinking out loud (which we would ask to record)

We’ll send a participation agreement and ask if you have any questions before you decide.

We can’t offer monetary compensation to federal employees.
