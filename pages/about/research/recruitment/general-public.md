The U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) provides basic common elements for federal websites, and we value the public’s opinions and insights. Join our usability research program to play a crucial role in making government websites more accessible and user-friendly.


## What is usability research?

{:.border-top-2px .border-base-lighter .padding-top-1}

Usability research is the process of learning about people’s needs and observing how they interact with websites so we can make improvements that will improve the many government sites that use USWDS. For example, we might ask someone to use a not-yet-published website so we can see which parts might be confusing. Then, we can make changes based on what we learned.

## How to get involved

**We’re currently looking for people who have a visual disability to help us do this research.** If you’re blind or have low vision, have a device with a web browser (a desktop, laptop, tablet, or smartphone), and have an internet connection, we would love to hear from you! You don’t need to be tech savvy or an expert in using websites to participate.
