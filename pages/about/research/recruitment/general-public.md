The U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) provides basic common elements for federal websites, and we value the public’s opinions and insights. Join our usability research program to play a crucial role in making government websites more accessible and user-friendly.


## What is usability research?

{:.border-top-2px .border-base-lighter .padding-top-1}

Usability research is the process of learning about people’s needs and observing how they interact with websites so we can make improvements that will improve the many government sites that use USWDS. For example, we might ask someone to use a not-yet-published website so we can see which parts might be confusing. Then, we can make changes based on what we learned.

## How to get involved

**Right now, we’d like to talk with people who have disabilities to help us understand your needs.** For example, if you’re blind or have low vision, or a cognitive disability, and have a device with a web browser (a desktop, laptop, tablet, or smartphone), and an internet connection, we would love to hear from you! You don’t need to be tech savvy or any kind of expert in using websites to participate.

**Sign up:** Fill out this brief [sign up form](https://touchpoints.app.cloud.gov/touchpoints/b0c4b589/submit) or email us at <{{ site.uswds_email }}> to tell us you’re interested. We’ll then reach out when we have a research opportunity for you.

Your participation is completely voluntary, and you can decide to be taken off our list of possible participants at any time by emailing us at <{{ site.uswds_email }}>.
